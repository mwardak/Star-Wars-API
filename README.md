## Summary

 I created this app to learn how data is retrieved from an external api. I decided to use functional components to build this app and found it easier to work with vs class components. 

 I learned how to create pagination functionality around the resulting data returned from the Star Wars Api. This was also my first project working with REST API's and it was interesting to learn how data was retrieved and displayed in my application. React is the first JavaScript library  that I have actually enjoyed learning and plan to stick with as I continue building apps.
