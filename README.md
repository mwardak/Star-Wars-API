## Summary

 I created this app to learn how data is retrieved from an external api. I decided to use functional componenst to build this app and found it easier to work with vs class components. 

 I also learned how to create pagination functionality around the resulting data returned from the Star Wars Api. This was challengin at first but after finding the solution I realized that it was easier than I thought. Bootstrap also saved me hours of styling in CSS and gave it a nice subtle design. As I continue my journey into software development my appreciation for React has grown.
